This time I had to rewrite the web-site again and here are the main changes:
-mostly deleted all css styles (except the blockquote, img, code, trainer-name and profile-card)
-made responsible navigation bar for all gadgets (phones, desktops, tablets)
-made all pages responsible for all gadgets
-used bootstrap for blockqoutes and alerts (I hope these things weren't in lectures)
-tried to maintain the same color scheme and special elements
