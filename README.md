First of all, to follow the requirements I had to rewrite nearly everything in main.css and I started with body. I’ve added line-height for readability and colors to it:
 
Then I’ve decided to rewrite header and footer, here how they were looking like: 
And how they’re looking like right now: 
 
(P.S. I’ve changed padding to 10px because 20px was too big)
I combined them to make it easier to write, because they had pretty much similar parameters, but also, I had to make footer’s position fixed, so I had no choice but to write its additional parameters below:
 
Added “margin: 0” to navigation bar’s unordered lists:
 
Styled “nav a” and added to it hover effect:
 
That’s how paragraphs and headers were last time:
 
And that’s how it looks like now:
 
Code was to display special texts; I’ll return to it later.
Next were spacing and alignment:
 
Then there were selectors:
 
Changed layouts and images parameters:
 
 
I’ve decided to create styling for trainers’ profile cards to put them in wellness.html:
 

Then styled a form from contact.html:
 
Restyled tables:

Moving to html files, starting from main page:
 
 
Changed navigation bar, now links in a side bar have hover orange effect when clicking on them, a little border around the main section and side bar. Also removed footers from every page except the home and contact pages.
Used <code> in: fitness.html and nutrition.html
 
 
 
 
Added a trainer’s profile card to the wellness.ht ml
 
Changed a little the contact.html page:
 
 
Submit button is changing its color when you navigate to it:
