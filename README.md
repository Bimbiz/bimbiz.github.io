Report: Creating the “Healthy Lifestyle & Fitness” Website

Project Goal
The goal of this project was to create a simple, multi-page website that promotes a healthy lifestyle. The site includes sections about fitness routines, nutrition, wellness, and contact information. It was designed with a clean structure, simple navigation, and images to make the content engaging.

Structure
The website consists of several HTML pages:

Home Page: An introduction with a welcome message, an image, and quick links.

Fitness Page: A workout plan, weekly schedule, and an image.

Nutrition/Wellness Pages: Informational sections.

Contact Page: A form where users can enter their name, email, and a question.

All pages share a consistent header (with navigation links) and a footer (with contact details).

Layout & Design
Header and Footer:

The header contains the site title and navigation menu.

Both header and footer use a green background that stretches across the whole width of the page.

CSS was used to fix alignment and spacing.

Main Content:

The text sections (headings, paragraphs, lists) were styled with proper margins.

Tables were used for the weekly workout schedule.

Blockquotes with author attribution were used for citations.

Images:

Images were added to make the site visually appealing as much as possible for me right now. 4. CSS Styling

Flexbox: Used in .content sections to align text and images side by side. Example:

.content { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px; }

Typography and Spacing: Margins were added at the beginning of text paragraphs for readability.

Responsive Design: The layout adjusts when the screen is smaller, so the image stacks under the text.

Forms
The Contact Page includes a form with:

Name input

Email input

Question input

Submit button

The form was centered using Flexbox, and spacing was applied for usability.
